- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Encapsulation seems very intricate as there are many pieces to create and you have to constantly be considering the bigger picture. Without the extended guidance from the README and the given attributes and methods, I don't think I would have been able to think of everything that was needed and create this program from scratch. However, it is very satisfying when all the little peices tie together in the end. It was also interesting for me to realize that you needed to create the Engine and Car objects inside of the Train constructor. This helped me better understand the 'composition' association. Another thing was when testing out the boarding feature in main, I had to realize that you have to get the Car from the Train, instead of creating a new Car, because the Car objects had already been created in the Train constructor.

I think overall this assignment was the most straightforward to follow so far, I think I just personally forget that the code is not always complete, and I need to add my own methods. For example, I only realized that I needed to add a toString() method in the Passengers class after running some tests in main.
